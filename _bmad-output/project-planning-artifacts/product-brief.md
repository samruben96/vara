# vara - Product Brief

> A modern digital safety platform built specifically for women.

---

## Executive Summary

**vara** brings protection, privacy, and control together in one intuitive experience. It is the first dedicated consumer platform designed specifically for women's digital safety—filling a critical gap where cybersecurity protects devices, platforms protect themselves, but no one protects *people*.

**Core Value Proposition:** vara gives women a single place to manage their digital safety through personalized protection plans, continuous monitoring, early threat detection, and calm, actionable guidance.

---

## Problem Statement

### The Crisis

Digital safety has reached a breaking point, and women feel the impact first.

**AI has lowered the cost of harm to zero:**
- Anyone can create synthetic images, impersonate identities, or scrape photos in seconds
- Deepfake generation tools are freely accessible
- Automated harassment at scale requires minimal effort

**Abuse is scaling faster than platforms can respond:**
- Reporting systems were built for single incidents, not automated AI-driven attacks
- Cross-platform harassment falls through the cracks
- Victims must navigate multiple disconnected tools and processes

**Women's digital exposure has never been higher:**
- Dating apps, professional visibility, social media, and community engagement all increase risk
- Public-facing careers (content creators, professionals) amplify exposure
- The line between online and offline safety has blurred

**No consumer product exists for this moment:**
- Cybersecurity tools protect devices
- Platforms protect themselves (and their liability)
- Women have no dedicated layer of personal protection

### The Gap

There is no unified, proactive, woman-centered solution for:
- Detecting deepfakes and non-consensual imagery
- Monitoring for impersonation and identity misuse
- Tracking cross-platform harassment
- Providing clear guidance when threats emerge
- Reducing anxiety while increasing protection

## Target Users

### Primary Audience

**General women ages 18-45** — the primary targets of online harassment, image-based abuse, and digital stalking.

### High-Value Segments

| Segment | Specific Needs |
|---------|----------------|
| **Content creators / Influencers** | Higher exposure, public presence, scraped images |
| **Dating app users** | Risk of stalking, harassment from matches, image misuse |
| **Professionals with public presence** | LinkedIn exposure, professional reputation protection |
| **Survivors of harassment/abuse** | Need monitoring for ongoing threats, evidence collection |

### Technical Sophistication

**Mixed audience** — the product must be:
- Simple and guided enough for non-technical users (no jargon, clear actions)
- Powerful and comprehensive enough for privacy-conscious, informed users

## Core User Experience

### Entry Point: Scan & Assess

New users begin with a comprehensive initial scan:

1. **Connect & Input** — User provides information (name, images, accounts to monitor)
2. **Comprehensive Scan** — vara scans across all threat vectors
3. **Exposure Report** — Clear visualization of current digital exposure and risks
4. **Protection Plan** — Personalized recommendations based on findings
5. **Ongoing Monitoring** — Continuous protection with proactive alerts

### Data Sources (MVP)

| Source | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Public web** | Open internet scanning for images, mentions, content |
| **Social media surfaces** | Public profile monitoring, impersonation detection |
| **User-connected accounts** | Authorized access for deeper monitoring of user's own presence |
| **Dark web monitoring** | Leaked databases, underground markets, breach data |
| **Data breach databases** | Known compromised credentials and personal data |
